					<h3>Project Analysis Overview</h3>
						<ul>
						
							<li>
							The Theatre Downtown website was in need of a redesign due to the fact that there is no real design to it. That it is 
							basically thrown together with little or no thought to design to it. The main navigation is a combination of links that 
							are underlined and a few others were not. The links are different size, just to fit the text in the boxes.
