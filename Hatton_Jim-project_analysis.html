				<h2>Site Content</h2>
					<p>
						The Theatre Downtown website was in need of a redesign due to the fact that there is no real design to it. That it was
						basically thrown together with little or no thought to design to it. The main navigation is a combination of links that 
						are underlined and a few others were not, also the columns of the links in the main nav are different sizes. The site had 
						some many errors in the html.

				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						The closet business to it, according to the alexa.com is "The Orlando Shakespeare Theatre" located on the web at 
						<a href="http://orlandoshakes.org/">Orlando Shakespeare</a>  The theatre group scored a 26 according to the google 
						search done for the group, unlike my client score that wasn't even on the google search page. We can correct this
						with the new redesign site and give the business it share of visits on the web and hope to add business to the site.
						I hope to establish the organization with a new presence and feel to the site. The information is located at the following 
						pages on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/theatredowntown.net">alexa.com</a>

				<h4>Targeted Audience</h4> 
					<p>The target audience for this site would be adults between 30-50, with women over 30 being the main group for attending 
					the shows. While the middle to the upper class would likely to attend as well, but anyone that loved the performing arts 
					could also be in attendance as well.
