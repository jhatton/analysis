				<h2>Site Content</h2>
					<p>
						The Theatre Downtown website was in need of a redesign due to the fact that there is no real design to it. That it is 
						basically thrown together with little or no thought to design to it. The main navigation is a combination of links that 
						are underlined and a few others were not. The links are different size, just to fit the text in the boxes.

				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>The closet business to it, according to the alexa.com is "The Orlando Shakespeare Theatre" located on the web at 
					<a href="http://orlandoshakes.org/">Orlando Shakespeare</a>  The theatre group scored a 26 according to the google 
					search done for the group, unlike our client wasn't scored on the google search page. Hopefully we can correct this
					with the new redesign site. I hope to establish the organization with a new presence and feel to the site. The 
					information is located at the following pages on alexa.com<a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/theatredowntown.net">

				<h4>Targeted Audience</h4> 
					<p>The targeted audience should be the upper class range of people, with women above 30 being the more likely to attend, 
					according to the research done on the Shakespearean group. The theatre would most likely attract all range of races and 
					religions, just for the love of the performing arts. The information on this brief was collected through varies place 
					throughout the internet. I hope to establish my client to a new heights on the web.
